							<h2>A SHARED SERVICES COMMUNITY</h2>
							<div class="lead">Over the last 6 years, the Intelligence Community has boldly initiated some of the largest IT modernization efforts in its history and quickly moving toward open, agile architectures to realize a unified vision for securely discovering, accessing and sharing data.</div>
							<p>IC ITE is a significant change to IC IT’s operating model as it shifts from an agencycentric IT architecture to a common platform that eliminates redundancy in the IT portfolio through shared technologies, information, and resources “on-demand” to meet mission needs. To realize the true potential in this shared environment, trust and partnership must be realized across the Community and adapt IT operations into an integrated enterprise culture that truly relies on one another to securely provide information and to maintain critical IT needs.</p>

							<p>Therefore, each IC element becomes capable of exploring the trade space to leverage what is desired and available and reallocate resources to build what is necessary. The intended result is an efficient “shared services” model for consolidating business operations that are used by many and sharing these capabilities and resources so that organizations can scale rapidly to address emergent and unexpected range of threats.</p>

							<p>For the IC, IC ITE is a significant shift in how to plan, develop and operate IT as it moves the Community from a collection of agency-centric enterprises to a single, secure, mutually operated and integrated enterprise. In this model, the IC recognizes that each agency has particular strengths or core competencies that can be better leveraged by designating IC elements to act as Service Providers for specific capabilities for the entire Community. </p>

										<p>“IC ITE is trying to take the IC to the next level of integration and information sharing, adding it’s no t just about an IT upgrade, but more about making a fundamental change in the way the IC operates in terms of processes and people…”</p>
										<footer>- General (retired) James Clapper, <cite title="Source Title">Director National Intelligence</cite></footer>
									</blockquote>
								</div>
							</div>


							<p>Furthermore, DNI designates the IC Service Providers who will be responsible for determining investment requirements and using their respective budget and acquisition authorities to execute the IC ITE responsibilities. In the end state, DNI expects all agencies to be leveraging the IC ITE shared services platform with each providing or paying for enterprise services. For its part, the initial IC ITE services will focus on the delivery of a common IC desktop, common back office tools, standardized access to analytic tools and applications, and data-centric computing using government-developed (GovCloud) and commercial cloud architectures (C2S).</p>

							<p>Cloud computing is DNI’s model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. What this means in plain terms is the ability for end users to utilize parts of bulk resources and that these resources can be acquired quickly and easily.</p>

							<p class="highlight"><span>INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE (IAAS) -</span> As tenants of IC ITE cloud, one can gain substantial benefits under any of the operating models outlined earlier. Be it a series of servers, remote desktops, Agile tools or core software, they all can rapidly and conveniently be provisioned on an on-demand basis. This means the user(s) of the cloud services will have a sign-on account to their services and can provision, turn on/off or remove any of the resources without long delay. Examples of virtualized resources include: servers, load-balancers, firewalls, switches, memory and storage. Unlike traditional on premise Infrastructures and data-centers that required lead-time to configure and set-up the infrastructure, these resources are set-up as a shared-pool on a network therefore can quickly be provisioned with nominal effort.</p>

							<p class="sec-highlight"><span>Gov Cloud and Commercial Cloud Services (C2S)</span> – In 2015, the IC collectively spent $15.3B dollars on maintaining siloed datacenter operations. By adopting IaaS cloud services, each agency will no longer have to bear the burden of the sunk costs associated with acquiring and maintaining servers, the networks, and storage to host mission critical applications. Instead, each agency will virtually provision the infrastructure (compute, storage, networking) desired and only pay for what resources are consumed. This becomes a tremendous advantage for the IC since the capital costs of IT are decreased which can be diverted to mission critical priorities.</p>

							<p>The IC Cloud offers on-demand, virtualized computing resources over the network with current services operating from Region 1 on the East Coast. The most central and well-known of these services include the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (C2S), also known as “EC2” or Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Cloud services are considered elastic and ideal for organizations with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. As result, warfighters, operatives, and analysts will experience improved mobility as the data and applications they require are always available no matter where they are in the world as long as they maintain an internet connection.</p>

							<p class="sec-highlight"><span>Identification, Authorization, and Authentication (IAA)</span> – Information security is essential for the successful adoption of shared services and cloud computing. If individual agencies take an inconsistent approach in the areas of data tagging and identify access management, the result will be a continuation of today’s stovepipes that are incapable of interoperating with one another. IAA is the security and business service that “enables the right individuals to access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons.” IAA is the task of controlling information about users on computers.</p>

							<p>Such information includes information that authenticates the identity of a user, and information that describes information and actions they are authorized to access and/or perform. It also includes the management of descriptive information about the user and how and by whom that information can be accessed and modified. Managed entities typically include users, hardware and network resources and even applications. IC ITE policies, procedures, and tools will support portability and consistency of individual access across the IC for the majority of datasets in order to provide seamless and secure enterprise solutions for trusted collaboration. While many IA functions are designed to prohibit certain datasets from being accessed, the ultimate objective is to enable enhanced and relevant intelligence production in real time.</p>

							<p>This happens through sharing information with authorized individuals and enabling processes for information discovery. As part of the information discovery process, individuals will be permitted different levels of discover based on their role and the corresponding information they are attempting to access. With IC ITE’s common security model, access to data is controlled based on attribute based access control (ABAC) - where the attributes of the individual or a specific system rather than relying on securing the perimeter through various network and database enclaves operating at different classification levels. This data-centric approach provides additional transparency and control of information within a system. With the appropriate security measures, IC ITE provides the platform to emplace data-centric security models, identity management procedures, and data tagging to enable a common security framework approach.</p>

								<p class="highlight"><span>PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (PAAS)-</span> For the IC, this environment serves as the agencies and services innovation environment. Organizations can provision compute and storage from the infrastructure as a service (IaaS), such as C2S or GovCLD. PaaS does not typically replace a business’ entire infrastructure.</p>

								<p>Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services, such as Java development or application hosting. For example, deploying a typical business tool locally might require an IT team to buy and install hardware, operating systems, middleware (such as databases, Web servers and so on) the actual application, define user access or security, and then add the application to existing systems management or application performance monitoring tools.</p>

								<p>IT teams must then maintain all of these resources over time. A PaaS provider, however, supports all the underlying computing and software and the users only need to log in and start using the platform. These truly common components for software development, collaboration, platform monitoring which could be redundant across an IT portfolio if not used as a shared resource.</p>

								<p>The benefit to this model is that organizations do not need to worry about building and maintaining a specific storage or hosting infrastructure. Tenants can leverage the resource sharing characteristics of the cloud to pay-as-they-go and become sole consumers of these solution. Furthermore, they will be abstracted from low-level details of the environments and maintained and can shift their focus on rapidly developing features.</p>

							<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10">
								<p class="highlight"><span>SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS) -</span> Cloud services like SaaS offer high scalability, which gives customers the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand from any internet-enabled location. Cloud’s resource pooling mechanism will create economies of scale for shared resources (storage, memory, hardware) due to multi-tenancy usage and sharing of the up-front set-up and maintenance costs.</p>

								<p>An example of SaaS is a Geo Spatial software which many IC elements require it in order to visualize geographic data over a general global view. The global view data requires its own storage and software licensing in order to be functional. In a traditional IT scenario with de-centralized data centers, every organization would pay individually for software licensing, and for hardware and storage. However, with cloud’s SaaS model, this unique, yet general software can be installed once in the cloud and every tenant can share the licensing cost.</p>

								<p class="sec-highlight"><span>Common Desktop</span> – Central to IC ITE is the common desktop environment (DTE). The aim is to deliver a common suite of desktop applications and access to common services including Unified Communications as a Service. The IC DTE is managed by a Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) led by Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The DTE is the one place that the IC uses consumption of IC ITE services. The desktop has a common look and feel regardless of agency and serves as the single shared interface that users interact with on a day-to-day basis to access services made available through IC ITE.</p>

								<p>Using a common look-and-feel, DTE will be transparent to the user in providing access to applications, cloud services, help desk and system management functions, identity access control, and security functions. DIA and NGA have deployed the first iteration of the common desktop and have added a number of new capabilities along with updated versions of current software products.</p>

								<p>The agencies have enhanced the DTE’s unified communications capabilities by offering a common collaboration tool, which provides a single interface for secure voicemail integration with email, peer-topeer file sharing, web-browser, a screen capture tool and Outlook calendar integration. As additional agencies transition into the common operating environment, more services will become available for community-wide use and collaboration.</p>

								<p class="sec-highlight"><span>Application Mall</span> – Under the IC ITE strategy, shared services include an applications mall, managed by the National Security Agency (NSA) that will function in the same manner as Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Developed applications from across the enterprise will be published and made available for download for customized desktops.</p>

								<p class="sec-highlight"><span>Enterprise Management (EMT)</span>The IC’s Enterprise Management (or EMT) service enables IC ITE to perform as a single integrated Enterprise – via a cloud based Service Integration and Management (SIAM) capability. EMT is the key enabler of relationships between service providers and IC ITE customers, the hub of IC ITE customer experience, and an enabler of IC ITE adoption. While DTE is the entry point for users into IC ITE, EMT is the hub that connects users to services and possibilities that IC ITE provides in support of the mission. EMT is the enabler of Information Technology services for the end users – by making services easily accessible (service catalog, service provisioning), resolving issues (service desk/self-service), monitoring health of services (and tracking performance against SLAs/ OLAs), and keeping track of service and resource usage across the IC. As such, EMT services are intended to meet information technology service management needs of all intelligence community components and partners across four principal service areas.</p>

					<p>By transforming to a “modern data infrastructure”  enterprise, the IC will not only be more efficient, but will also establish a powerful platform to deliver more innovative technology to desktops at all levels across the Community. With the latest cloud technologies, operating as an enterprise will enable intelligence data to be linked to exploit data science and predictive analytics. Seamless and secure access to Community wide information will positively transform how users collaborate and perform their missions. The efficiencies gained through consolidation and shared services will not only allow the IC to be technically agile but also achieve mission agility and fiscal agility to realign cost savings to other mission priorities.</p>

					<p>However, this technology evolution will require the IC to navigate the technical challenges related to managing a bi-modal IT environment. Although much progress has been made with IC ITE, the IC will continue to sustain overlapping legacy capabilities, even greater IT operating costs, and vendor-driven technologies - requiring rapid adoption while the technology remains relevant. From an organizational standpoint, adoption of disruptive digital ideas will be challenging despite the obvious benefits. As the IC ITE implementation continues and shared services are enabled, decisions must be made by individual IC elements regarding adoption and reuse of these capabilities. Each agency will also have a unique role in determining the necessary changes to existing business processes to maximize the benefits of digital transformation and then mature its workforce through training and education to gain the appropriate skills to execute in the new IC ITE operating model. Chapters 4-6 outline our three-tiered approach which considers the tools and techniques an organization can leverage to harness the power of digital and guide the organizational journey to a successful Digital Enterprise.</p>
