							<h2>REIMAGINING HOW WORK GETS DONE</h2>
							<div class="lead">The Digital Era can be transformative, but re-engineering business processes and incremental adoption of digital enablers has become a hurdle for many.</div>
							<p>The digital ecosystem is empowering clients in new ways and disrupting their organizations. This explosion of disruptive digital technologies is driving an unparalleled increase in customer demands and expectations. When coupled with increasing cost pressures, organizations now face an uphill battle in trying to keep pace with their customers. The consumers’ expectations for on demand engagement, experience and interaction are now the driving forces for digital ecosystem integration.</p>

							<p>Antiquated operating models based on rigid processes and supported by legacy IT environments now limit the ability to respond in today’s rapidly changing environment. Evolving technology is also quickly becoming a differentiator for client success. Implementation of digital capabilities is a necessity to stay competitive and efficient, but without an overarching digital strategy that includes an incremental approach — the learning curve and potential to introduce unnecessary risk is high. In addition, competitive cost pressures are continuing to increase. Without digital experts shaping a strategy, meeting these budget constraints can be impossible. As technology choices continue to evolve, organizations need a way to realign business processes without being a digital expert.</p>

							<p>The greatest challenge for the IC today is that the workforce doesn’t have the luxury of knowing what business events will require future business solutions. Transition from the traditional IT environment creates an on-demand information culture that can only be supported through modular IT infrastructures that bridge cross boundary processes enmeshed in organizational silos. Digitally transformed organizations will now be able to develop secure digital solutions to accelerate innovation and delivery of solutions by following the tenets of using open source development and deploying optimized processes framed by proven Agile and DevOps approaches.</p>

							<p>In order to maximize the potential of new digital platforms and capabilities, the IC must re-imagine its processes for exploiting interoperability, reuse existing capabilities, and rapidly deploy new services across the enterprise. Employing the use of open standards makes it possible to integrate processes that weren’t originally designed to work together while conforming to a universally recognized set of industry standards for greater adoption.</p>

							<p>Therefore, it is imperative to look within the IC’s core problem areas to determine the key areas for digital insertion. Understanding how the IC disseminates information, engages stakeholders and plans for the future allows the digital team to ensure that the organization’s technology environment and costs align with business needs while also improving the experience of customers and staff as they interact with new and innovative digital capabilities.</p>

							<p class="highlight"><span>ASSESSING THE DIGITAL MATURITY OF THE ORGANIZATION WILL DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF TECHNICAL, PROCESS, AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE REQUIRED FOR ENTERPRISE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.</span> Performing a digital “quick look” will serve in evaluating key touch points and technologies that drive an enterprise and its workforce will result in deep insights into internal processes and desired user experiences and value propositions. Senior executives can then tackle pressing organizational, technological and functional needs among internal and external constituents by rapidly measuring the performance and capabilities of an organization against the characteristics of a mature, high performing organization.</p>

							<p class="highlight"><span>INITIAL ASSESSMENTS OF KEY PROCESSES WILL ENABLE SENIOR EXECUTIVES TO RE-IMAGINE THE WAY WORK GETS DONE AND TRANSFORM INTO A DIGITAL ORGANIZATION.</span> As a secondary step, process redesign can logically occur which re-imagines business processes to ensure successful implementation of digital capabilities. Application of new “digital workflows” will allow reinvention of business processes by applying open, agile enterprise concepts and SMAC-X capabilities to provide benefits previously unrecognized.</p>

							<p>Transforming to a fully integrated intelligence network requires a multi-faceted view of the enterprise which seeks to not only change technology but also introduce the IC’s organizational policies, revise operational procedures, and combat cultural challenges with a concerted organizational change management agenda.</p>

							<!-- 6.1 -->


							<h3>6.1 ENTERPRISE CHANGE MANAGEMENT FOR THE IC</h3>
							<div class="lead">Moving to a shared architecture and IT shared services model will require significant cultural change in the IC, driven by the overarching need to share mission-related data.</div>

							<p>Unfortunately, the largest and most established IC elements offer the strongest resistance to change and risk averse due to deeply embedded processes. In addition, old habits can get in the way of progress as cultural barriers and tolerance to change need to be overcome. Therefore, change management must be driven from the top with IC leadership actively driving the cultural, organizational, and policy changes required to implement the IC ITE.</p>

							<p>Technology enablers can create platforms to enable and help facilitate the desired cultural changes on the mission side, while also stimulating complementary cultural changes in the IT organizations and workforces. As a result, IC elements will be required to develop migration plans for transition of current operations and data to the IT Enterprise environment. As more transparency and understanding is achieved about the implementation details for IC ITE, diminished barriers between the IC elements will occur and a stronger collaborative culture.</p>
							
							<p>EXECUTE A CHANGE STRATEGY- Each IC element possesses its own view versus the IC enterprise viewpoint. To realize IC ITE’s true potential in this shared environment trust and partnership must be realized across the Community and evolve IC ITE to an integrated enterprise culture. Implementing a change strategy is critical for Service Providers and Service Consumers to adopt IC ITE. The change strategy defines the required leadership and actions as well as the current challenges and importance of shared services to the IC missions. Leaders across the IC will have to continuously inform and reassure the workforce and other stakeholders about how the standardization as a part of shared services will enhance their ability to achieve the mission—and continually communicate the benefits and successes. Leaders must clearly communicate that IC ITE will enable agencies to share information and capabilities “ondemand” to meet mission needs. The results provide an efficient model for resource sharing, eliminate finger pointing, and enable rapid scalability to emergent requirements.</p>

							<p>FORMULATE IC ITE COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH PLANS- Communication and Outreach Plans focuses on building awareness for agency service consumers. The intent of these plans should be to establish relationships with service providers to actively conduct communications and outreach activities, ensure awareness of IC ITE activities, and identify areas for collaboration and address common issues. Maintaining momentum for anchoring IC ITE adoption will require executive leadership to establish integration as a priority. Therefore, a dedicated change leadership team will greatly enhance the ability to tackle IC ITE adoption issues and ensures a unified agreement across the agencies when addressing organizational resistance and cultural barriers.</p>

							<p>MONITOR IC ITE ADOPTION- Over the next three years, the percentage of services delivered by IC ITE rather than by DIA/DoDIIS-unique systems will steadily increase. The investment the IC has already made in IC ITE is significant, and IC ITE adoption across the IC is a mandate. Still, attempting to accelerate adoption simply because it is required will not yield desired results. As Service Providers deliver and expose services, it will be critical to discern the effectiveness of IC ITE adoption. Change teams must work across the IC to spearhead IC ITE interest and awareness, build confidence in IC ITE services, communicate efficiencies and cost savings to attract IC ITE tenants, simplify migration and development, and seek avenues to continuously improve operational services and support.</p>

							<h3>6.2 MODERN GOVERNANCE MODEL</h3>
							<div class="lead">Transformational change to an IT Shared Services model requires invested leadership with a commitment that is predicated on fully executing toward a common vision.</div>

							<p>This digital transformation effort is a revolutionary shift that the IC is attempting can only occur with the commitment of the mission, Executive Officers, and policy leadership from the ODNI and each IC agency. IT shared services model will require a robust governance approach focused not only on individual IC agencies, but also incorporates the viewpoints and guidance of its stakeholders. A mutually agreed upon governance structure will enable multi-domain, multi-INT capabilities integration into IC ITE. For this approach to work, the IC must enable decision-making and governance of the IT shared services centrally rather than divided among the IC elements.</p>

							<p>Due to the complexity, scope, and aggressive timelines involved, the IC must exercise an agile implementation approach to develop and implement new capabilities while adhering to established capability roadmaps. Therefore, a successful IC ITE governance model will consider the ‘enterprise’ IT portfolio and find ways to employ the tenets of interoperability and take advantage of what’s currently available for reuse rather than the legacy mindset of controlling a limited capability. Leveraging ‘integrated’ Information Technology Review Boards (ITRB) within the new governance model will allow holistic consideration different mission sets, policies, priorities, requirements, design, and cost to serve the entire IC enterprise.</p>

							<p>Lastly, building confidence in IC ITE provided services is critical for mission customer who may be skeptical of IC ITE’s value proposition. Once shared services are in place, the governance for the delivery of the services must be migrated from the overall model to one owned by the Service Provider and focused on the execution of its responsibilities. Service delivery is paramount to the success of IT Shared Services and understanding customer requirements and monitoring the IC’s ability to meet those requirements is critical.</p>

							<p>Although service delivery will be decentralized, the shared services governance model will oversee the monitoring of continuous service improvement to meet emerging challenges, exploit new technology, and share mission capabilities. Digital transformation primarily involves the modernization of IT infrastructures to promote information sharing and set the stage for the adoption of new cost effective technologies that increase capabilities through faster delivery of intuitive IT systems, enhance data mining &amp; analytics, increase enterprise mobility, and ensure improved defense against cyber threats and vulnerabilities. To accomplish this, it involves the use of open architectures to promote interoperability, open source components to maximize reusability, open standards to foster cohesive development, open communities to invite sharing and innovation, and open data to make information more available to users.</p>

							<p>Digital transformation also compels business activities to shift and become faster and virtual resulting in work processes undergo significant transformations as new technology allows information to be created, exchanged, secured, and processed in very different ways.</p>

							<p>On-demand engagement, heightened user experience, remote data access, and cloud based analytics are the new capability standards which organizations must begin to transform their workforce and operations into to become effective digital workplaces. Therefore, increased education and promotion of career-broadening opportunities must be added to sustain this new workforce. Workforce analysis and investment are essential to meet evolving intelligence mission requirements and the IC must assess existing programmatic and technical expertise, and attract, hire, and grow an agile, high performance workforce that understands the depth and breadth of the intelligence mission to more effectively identify and implement seamless, secure enterprise solutions to mission requirements.</p>

							<p>The IC ITE strategy is a game changing technology investment and a paradigm shift of legacy operating models. As the IC moves toward implementing new digital capabilities to better enable intelligence discovery and data sharing, leaders within the Community must accelerate the establishment of open architectures and standards to allow technologists to apply leading edge and transformational capabilities. For data to be shared and accessed across intelligence agencies, the Community will also need to rethink how it defines and executes its data security and access control in a virtualized, cloud-enabled delivery architecture.</p>

							<p>Technological advancement and innovation in IT is being led at great speed by the private sector. Leveraging these advancements has the potential to accelerate the DNI’s strategic intent for information sharing across agencies, intelligence disciplines and mission sets. In order to manage these historic changes in operations and the supporting cultural shift to enable sharing data across the IC, leaders will also need to restructure coordination, synchronization, and governance from control within stovepipes to one that fully leverages innovation across the enterprise. Information sharing and the quality of analytics and operations are critical. Data sharing can help stakeholders make better decisions using advanced analytics. With this, the IC has the opportunity to collaborate and help turn big data into enriched data, providing decision makers, operatives, and warfighters the right data at the right time and place to make the most informed decisions.</p>
