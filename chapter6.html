							<h2>REIMAGINING HOW WORK GETS DONE</h2>
							<div class="lead">The Digital Era can be transformative, but re-engineering business processes and incremental adoption of digital enablers has become a hurdle for many.</div>
							<p>The digital ecosystem is empowering clients in new ways and disrupting their organizations. This explosion of disruptive digital technologies is driving an unparalleled increase in customer demands and expectations. When coupled with increasing cost pressures, organizations now face an uphill battle in trying to keep pace with their customers. The consumers’ expectations for on demand engagement, experience and interaction are now the driving forces for digital ecosystem integration.</p>

							<p>Antiquated operating models based on rigid processes and supported by legacy IT environments now limit the ability to respond in today’s rapidly changing environment. Evolving technology is also quickly becoming a differentiator for client success. Implementation of digital capabilities is a necessity to stay competitive and efficient, but without an overarching digital strategy that includes an incremental approach — the learning curve and potential to introduce unnecessary risk is high. In addition, competitive cost pressures are continuing to increase. Without digital experts shaping a strategy, meeting these budget constraints can be impossible. As technology choices continue to evolve, organizations need a way to realign business processes without being a digital expert.</p>

							<p>The greatest challenge for the IC today is that the workforce doesn’t have the luxury of knowing what business events will require future business solutions. Transition from the traditional IT environment creates an on-demand information culture that can only be supported through modular IT infrastructures that bridge cross boundary processes enmeshed in organizational silos. Digitally transformed organizations will now be able to develop secure digital solutions to accelerate innovation and delivery of solutions by following the tenets of using open source development and deploying optimized processes framed by proven Agile and DevOps approaches.</p>

							<p>In order to maximize the potential of new digital platforms and capabilities, the IC must re-imagine its processes for exploiting interoperability, reuse existing capabilities, and rapidly deploy new services across the enterprise. Employing the use of open standards makes it possible to integrate processes that weren’t originally designed to work together while conforming to a universally recognized set of industry standards for greater adoption.</p>

							<p>Therefore, it is imperative to look within the IC’s core problem areas to determine the key areas for digital insertion. Understanding how the IC disseminates information, engages stakeholders and plans for the future allows the digital team to ensure that the organization’s technology environment and costs align with business needs while also improving the experience of customers and staff as they interact with new and innovative digital capabilities.</p>

									<p class="highlight"> Performing a digital “quick look” will serve in evaluating key touch points and technologies that drive an enterprise and its workforce will result in deep insights into internal processes and desired user experiences and value propositions. Senior executives can then tackle pressing organizational, technological and functional needs among internal and external constituents by rapidly measuring the performance and capabilities of an organization against the characteristics of a mature, high performing organization.</p>

									<p class="highlight">As a secondary step, process redesign can logically occur which re-imagines business processes to ensure successful implementation of digital capabilities. Application of new “digital workflows” will allow reinvention of business processes by applying open, agile enterprise concepts and SMAC-X capabilities to provide benefits previously unrecognized.</p>

									<p>Transforming to a fully integrated intelligence network requires a multi-faceted view of the enterprise which seeks to not only change technology but also introduce the IC’s organizational policies, revise operational procedures, and combat cultural challenges with a concerted organizational change management agenda.</p>

						<h3>6.1 </br>IC ENTERPRISE CHANGE MANAGEMENT</h3>
						<div class="lead">Moving to a shared architecture and IT shared services model will require significant cultural change in the IC, driven by the overarching need to share mission-related data.</div>

						<p>Unfortunately, the largest and most established IC elements offer the strongest resistance to change and risk averse due to deeply embedded processes. In addition, old habits can get in the way of progress as cultural barriers and tolerance to change need to be overcome. Therefore, change management must be driven from the top with IC leadership actively driving the cultural, organizational, and policy changes required to implement the IC ITE.</p>

						<p>Technology enablers can create platforms to enable and help facilitate the desired cultural changes on the mission side, while also stimulating complementary cultural changes in the IT organizations and workforces. As a result, IC elements will be required to develop migration plans for transition of current operations and data to the IT Enterprise environment. As more transparency and understanding is achieved about the implementation details for IC ITE, diminished barriers between the IC elements will occur and a stronger collaborative culture.</p>

								<p class="highlight" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span>EXECUTE A CHANGE STRATEGY</span></p>
								<p class="highlight">Each IC element possesses its own view versus the IC enterprise viewpoint. To realize IC ITE’s true potential in this shared environment trust and partnership must be realized across the Community and evolve IC ITE to an integrated enterprise culture. Implementing a change strategy is critical for Service Providers and Service Consumers to adopt IC ITE. The change strategy defines the required leadership and actions as well as the current challenges and importance of shared services to the IC missions. Leaders across the IC will have to continuously inform and reassure the workforce and other stakeholders about how the standardization as a part of shared services will enhance their ability to achieve the mission—and continually communicate the benefits and successes. Leaders must clearly communicate that IC ITE will enable agencies to share information and capabilities “ondemand” to meet mission needs. The results provide an efficient model for resource sharing, eliminate finger pointing, and enable rapid scalability to emergent requirements.</p>

								<p  class="highlight">Communication and Outreach Plans focuses on building awareness for agency service consumers. The intent of these plans should be to establish relationships with service providers to actively conduct communications and outreach activities, ensure awareness of IC ITE activities, and identify areas for collaboration and address common issues. Maintaining momentum for anchoring IC ITE adoption will require executive leadership to establish integration as a priority. Therefore, a dedicated change leadership team will greatly enhance the ability to tackle IC ITE adoption issues and ensures a unified agreement across the agencies when addressing organizational resistance and cultural barriers.</p>

								<p class="highlight">Over the next several years, the percentage of services delivered by IC ITE rather than by DIA/DoDIIS-unique systems will steadily increase. The investment the IC has already made in IC ITE is significant, and IC ITE adoption across the IC is a mandate. Still, attempting to accelerate adoption simply because it is required will not yield desired results. As Service Providers deliver and expose services, it will be critical to discern the effectiveness of IC ITE adoption. Change teams must work across the IC to spearhead IC ITE interest and awareness, build confidence in IC ITE services, communicate efficiencies and cost savings to attract IC ITE tenants, simplify migration and development, and seek avenues to continuously improve operational services and support.</p>

						<h3>6.2 </br>MODERN GOVERNANCE MODEL</h3>
						<div class="lead">Transformational change to an IT Shared Services model requires invested leadership with a commitment that is predicated on fully executing toward a common vision.</div>

						<p>One of the greatest risks faced by IC ITE is organizational resistance and deep-rooted cultures across a disaggregated federation of agencies. Industry experience suggests the path to breaking down resistance and changing the culture lies in strong governance. A strong governance model will outline key responsibilities, assign them to the correct owners, allocate resources, provide accountability through benchmarks for measuring progress and render all these elements transparent to the enterprise. This transparency will lead to better collaboration in resolving issues and will build trust and confidence for both providers and end users. Transparent and data-driven governance and oversight processes have been critical to transitioning IT enterprises and proven in the private sector. </p>

						<p>Effective leaders who established similar governance structures will be able to make key decisions quickly, to communicate often and clearly, and to hold all levels of the organization accountable for meeting published timelines, milestones, metrics, and benchmarks on schedule. As a result, the resistance to change and cultural inertia embedded can be overcome with strong leadership, clear messaging, and strong enforcement. Furthermore, the most successful implementations balance standards and rigor with openness and flexibility to accommodate innovations at scale and changing user requirements. In addition, an integrated change and communication plan that enables communications across all governance levels and agencies regarding IC ITE are constant, transparent, coordinated, and involve input coming up from the user as well as decisions coming down from Executive Officers, and policy leadership from ODNI and each IC agency.</p>

						<p>The greatest challenge faced by IC ITE is one of integration by developing an ecosystem that will be able to support future IC capabilities with agility. To this end, a modern governance model becomes the cornerstone to the path forward to define, implement, and sustain a single, standards-based, interoperable enterprise architecture and survivable infrastructure to accomplish mission objectives and drive efficiencies across the enterprise. Today, the IC’s current governance models are focused on unique, agency-centric requirements that do not explore reuse of IC-wide capabilities.  However, a shared services model will require a robust governance approach focused not only on individual IC agencies, but incorporates the viewpoints and guidance of its stakeholders to make reuse of existing capabilities a primary theme. A mutually agreed upon governance structure will enable multi-domain, multi-INT capabilities integration into IC ITE. And for this approach to work, the IC must enable decision-making and governance of IT shared services centrally rather than divided among the IC elements.</p>

							<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-12 col-lg-12 wht-lead">The greatest challenge faced by IC ITE is one of integration by developing an ecosystem that will be able to support future IC capabilities with agility.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 intro" id="article-wrap" style="top:0;">
						<p>Due to the complexity, scope, and aggressive deployment timelines, the IC must exercise agile implementation approaches to implement new capabilities while adhering to established capability roadmaps. Therefore, a successful IC ITE governance practice will consider the ‘enterprise’ IT portfolio and find ways to employ common standards and the tenets of interoperability and take advantage of what’s currently available for reuse rather than the legacy mindset of controlling a limited capability. Leveraging ‘integrated’ Information Technology Review Boards (ITRB) within the new governance model will allow holistic consideration different mission sets, policies, priorities, requirements, design, and cost to serve the entire IC enterprise.</p>

						<p>These challenges, along with managing current legacy systems while transitioning to IC ITE, all speak to the need for a strong governance agenda. A clear vision for implementation and execution can be instituted by establishing accountability, executing a strong change and communication strategy, and developing a workforce with the appropriate skill sets. Adherence to strong programmatic practices and evolving the governance model at all levels is crucial to address the needs of different mission sets, priorities, and requirements of the IC enterprise while providing transparency in its process along with innovative thinking to plan strategically and act efficiently.</p>

						<p>Lastly, building confidence in IC ITE provided services is critical for mission customer who may be skeptical of IC ITE’s value proposition. Once shared services are in place, the governance for the delivery of the services must be migrated from the overall model to one owned by the Service Provider and focused on the execution of its responsibilities. Service delivery is paramount to the success of IT Shared Services and understanding customer requirements and monitoring the IC’s ability to meet those requirements is critical. Although service delivery will be decentralized, the shared services governance model will oversee the monitoring of continuous service improvement to meet emerging challenges, exploit new technology, and share mission capabilities.</p>
