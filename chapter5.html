							<h2>THE NEW BREED OF TALENT</h2>
							<div class="lead">Digital technology has revolutionized the way that organizations execute their work. Today, people hold as much computing and communication power in the palm of their hands as entire organizations did 30 years ago.</div>
							<p>As a result, the work itself is becoming more specialized and complex requiring more talent with specific expertise which requires organizations to fully embrace a new culture and mindset where employees are empowered with more autonomy and creative expression and innovation is sparked by leveraging an organization’s expansive network of staff.</p>

							<p>As business begins to embrace digital technologies; organizations need to motivate employees by investing in and promoting a corporate philosophy that values digital resources. Many employees have already adopted social and collaborative tools they are familiar with to improve their working relationships and increase their network of expertise. </p>

							<p>Commonly referred to as “digital natives,” many of these newer employees don’t remember a time without modern technology. Organizations should look to these technology-savvy employees as a valuable source of digital expertise. Instead of making uninformed decisions at a strategic level and pushing them down to staff without input; organizations benefit from creating an accessible environment that allows employees to recommend and investigate digital solutions and incorporate them into their day-to-day business practices.</p>

							<p>Cloud architectures and the shared services concept is a new paradigm for the IC. In due time and with proper implementation, the IC will experience economies of scale as these services move away from agency-level sustainment to the IC enterprise level.</p>

							<p>The associated sustainment costs should diminish while shifting the costs to other critical priorities – a trained modern workforce. During this period, the current IT workforce needs to be capable of implementing and supporting the early transition to a shared services solution. Reinvestment of IT savings will be needed to develop new skills as the IC ITE implementation evolves.</p>

							<p>To ensure future success for IC ITE, guidelines for the digital workforce to support implementation efforts must be continually developed. New skill sets to accomplish changing acquisition, security, and change management will need to be acquired. This new workforce will require expertise in the areas of service-level agreements (SLAs), revenue models, agile methodologies, shared services models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS), continuous integration frameworks, open source development, and cybersecurity capabilities. Therefore, increased training and incentives, strong recruiting, and rotating talent with industry will be required mechanism to surround the program with the appropriate skills.</p>

							<p>The IC must also be open to the employment of alternative tools and methodologies designed to identify specialized skills already resident within an organization and provide training designed to maximize the performance of employees with those skills sets. Emerging technologies require cloud architects, cloud analytics, data scientists, cyber specialists, data architects, and Agile developers which represent a high-demand resource pool but in low in supply. Coordinated actions to close the talent gap will require the IC and industry to work together to develop innovative means to capture, train, and retain this workforce. The IC must be willing to invest in comprehensive and specialized systems or processes that will assist in developing a talent strategy to ensure the organization is aptly equipped and successful when faced with future digital opportunities.</p>

							<p>Drawing on the tools that employees are already using to research, collaborate and engage with colleagues will resonate with employees and enhance agility and performance. To remain in lock step with industry, the IC will need to foster empowerment among employees to create a more engaged, loyal, and productive workforce. Empowered employees are better aligned to an organization’s business goals and therefore understand the knowledge and skills required to support current and future initiatives. In addition, providing clearly defined opportunities to develop and advance within the organization and then encouraging employees to reach and exceed those goals will result in better performance and higher retention.</p>

							<p>By retaining traditional employees and supplementing with contingent labor, companies have the capacity to easily adapt to the ebbs and flows of their workload. With today’s technology, organizations can now connect to talent in real time instead of wrestling with the inefficiencies of the past. Leveraging talent enablers such as Affiliate Networks and Crowdsourcing provides a unique way to find skilled labor and fill talent gaps while allowing organizations to be more agile and adaptable.</p>

							<p class="highlight"><span>THE AFFILIATE NETWORK</span> is a collection of desirable candidates made available through a digital on-demand talent platform. The Affiliate Network provides a number of advantages to companies seeking the right balance of employees including: attracting and retaining specialized talent, providing an excess of available staff seeking projects, the pursuit of cutting-edge technology and innovative ideas.</p>

							<p class="highlight"><span>CROWDSOURCING</span> is an innovative method by which an organization broadcasts a challenge, issue or task to an undefined crowd of people online and solicits their solutions and feedback to solve these problems. Crowdsourced talent allows organizations to immediately satisfy a need for specific talent as their business evolves and exposes itself to an unrestrained network of digital users with a range of skill sets and specialties that may not be resident within their current workforce. Organizations also have access to a larger pool of qualified candidates from which to recruit in order to build the most capable, skilled and experienced workforce.</p>

							<p>By taking advantage of a broader spectrum of talent, the IC can benefit in crucial ways. For instance, many organizations are bogged down by the administrative costs of staffing and required contributions to entitlements (social security, health insurance, worker’s compensation, and unemployment insurance). In this case, contingent labor is a viable alternative. Employers also get access to the most qualified hiring pools using the talent spectrum. Instead of the huge expense of hiring, onboarding, and training a full-time employee before being able to evaluate the quality of their work; with contract labor, employers can now “try it before they buy it.” Short-term staffing is no longer a “gapfilling” method, but rather a forward-thinking strategy to increase efficiency and improve the bottom line. Having the right talent on hand is an integral part of an organization’s success. This workforce shift has the potential to equip the IC with a more skilled and adaptable labor force, aligning itself with industry workforce trends, and positioning the government for long-term success.</p>
