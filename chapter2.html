							<h2>OUR VISION – AN OPEN AGILE ENTERPRISE</h2>
							<div class="lead">Organizations today are facing a common set of challenges – missions and requirements are expanding, budgets are shrinking, and an organization’s ability to automate processes, rapidly gather insight and respond to changing events is more critical than ever.</div>
							<p>Today’s users expect more capabilities, realtime access and consistent experience across organizational boundaries and devices. To do more with less, they need shareable capabilities that improve performance enterprise-wide.</p>

							<p>Today’s climate of reduced corporate investments and operating budgets, traditional methods must be transitioned toward an open, agile enterprise (OAE) concept that addresses the shift toward “on-demand” solutions and maximizes the innovations of shared services, platform standardization/ optimization, application rationalization,enterprise cloud capabilities, mobile device integration, and big data analytics.</p>

							<p>Figure 5 highlights the OAE transformation concept which includes evolving from manual to automated Systems Development using Agile/DevOps principles, moving from monolithic architectures to a micro services approach, getting away from closed,proprietary technology and focusing more on open solutions, all while integrating security throughout the entire process.</p>

							<p>Transforming to an Open Agile Enterprise provides the building blocks to design and deploy effective, mission-critical integrations on any scale, to improve efficiency and enhance interoperability. Whether integrating existing systems, adding new capabilities, or modernizing existing applications, this transformation path gives organizations a complete answer to a previously challenging environment.</p>

							<h5>Open Architecture with Standards-Based Integrations</h5>
							<p class="highlight" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span>(MODULAR, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN APPROACH TO ENABLE ASSEMBLY OF OPEN ARCHITECTURES)</span></p>
							<p class="highlight">This concept relies on an innovative, modular, and open design to ensure greater interoperability and fully integrated environments that eliminate complexity and increase results. OAE is focused on an “open source first” philosophy where the enterprise is built on fully open source software and shared within an enterprise to allow for maximum re-use in order to speed the delivery of solutions so that organizations may quickly adapt to changing business and technology environments. We believe that open systems create better performance for clients than proprietary ones. Open doesn’t just mean open source, but includes open architectures that allows systems to easily connect to other devices, apps, and systems (potentially including interfaces to contractor systems). By selecting applications that align to open standards and specifications, the client avoids vendor lock-in and preserves the flexibility to upgrade or entirely replace individual applications without adversely impacting other parts of the overall system.</p>

								<p class="highlight" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span>(DESIGN FOR THE FUTURE WITH FLEXIBLY TO SUPPORT INCREMENTAL TRANSFORMATION, AND EVOLVING REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY)</span></p>
								<p class="highlight"> Agile as a “mindset” defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through countless practices. Agile does not simply equate to delivering software in iterations called “Sprints;” but rather, represents a way of thinking that embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven development, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. This concept technically introduces abilities for orchestration of “tightly coupled but loosely architected” services and provides a platform for delivering solutions that are open, agile, and mission-focused to bring rapid and capability-rich solutions. With so many emerging digital capabilities, organizations must be able to quickly deploy capabilities and jettison obsolete technologies once considered innovative only a short time ago.</p>

								<h5>Enterprise Scale Capabilities and Reuse</h5>
								<p class="highlight" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span>ENCOURAGE RE-USE AND BUILD FOR RE-USE AT ENTERPRISE SCALE</span></p>
								<p class="highlight">Establishing a set of common enterprise services that can be reused across the enterprise avoids duplication, reduces sustainment costs, and accelerates the ability to integrate new applications. These services provide standard identity management, access control, common data access, and other core functions that are common across the portfolio. Common services also simplify, and reduce the cost, for information assurance and the certification and accreditation process. By viewing technology from an enterprise perspective, organizations will employ scaled, cloud-based micro-services and containerized architectures to force the re-use of services which shifts focus toward assembly versus development of solutions. This results in user defined provisioning of solutions and enables the agility required by the on-demand cultural shift of today’s modern organizations. The enterprise philosophy applies across the digital enterprise, which includes leadership, operational frontline workers, and support staff.</p>

								<p class="highlight" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span>Portfolio-based Approach to Modernization</span> </p>
								<p class="highlight">By analyzing and documenting the key mission processes and aligning them to the systems that support them, we provide a baseline view of the existing capabilities. This identifies dependencies, maximizes reuse, eliminates redundancy across applications, and allows the activities to be sequenced and tracked based on mission impact.</p>

						<h3>2.1 </br>TRANSFORMATION TO AN OPEN AGILE ENTERPRISE THROUGH ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION (EI)</h3>
						<div class="lead">The IC is challenged with providing an efficient and reliable services across organizational boundaries.</div>

						<p>To effectively do so necessitates a clear understanding of the mission needs of the stakeholder community and how they tie to bi-model IT environment in the current and proposed architecture. This understanding allows for evaluation of existing technology, identification of gaps and overlaps in the support, and identification of manual or outdated processes. The current architecture presents provisioning, reliability and efficiency challenges but cannot be transitioned until full traceability of the architecture is understood. As the IC elements move forward and aim to reduce operational costs, integration points with IC ITE and DODIIS will become critical to integrate and de-conflict with already available services.</p>

						<p>To move toward an Open, Agile Enterprise Architecture that is flexible and scalable, organizations will require a method for how they identify, evaluate, and implement innovative tools and technologies such as micro services plug-and-play architecture, containerization and performance management systems in to the existing architecture while maintaining an acceptable level of risk and addressing adoption challenges.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-3col-lg-3"><img src="images/ei-1.png" class="img-responsive" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
							<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9 global">
							<p>Booz Allen’s Enterprise Integration (EI) methodology provides an architecture-centric framework top-down and bottoms-up approach for create and manage a service portfolio providing bi-directional traceability to help make informed decisions. It provides the approach to help transform to open agile enterprises by breaking down monolithic, closed and unsustainable silos into reusable components and systems to meet cross-organizational needs and flush out inefficiencies. EI is designed to be a repeatable process to identify a phased implementation plan and make incremental improvements in the portfolio while maintaining an acceptable level of risk. We undertake a holistic mission analysis to visually map out the enterprise and identify critical mission operations. We map existing systems to the mission and then disassemble these systems into their functions to identify mission, common, and core components. We identify the common and core components that can be reused across the enterprise to reduce costs and eliminate redundant components to free up budget resources to invest in new mission capabilities.</p>
							<p>By establishing an inventory of the organization’s systems, applications and services, we enable organizations to identify a path forward quickly and with full visibility into the impacts. The goal is to provide key stakeholders the insights to optimize IT investments by creating common structure, identifying opportunities for re-use, or determining which legacy systems, can be retired. In the EI approach, this is done by evaluating and categorizing the portfolio by mission (those systems and services that are specific to a single mission), common (those systems and services that are common across stakeholders and missions), and core (those systems and services that support business processes). By understanding the holistic view of the mission, common and core systems and services the infrastructure moves from away from siloed applications and can achieve economies of scale.</p>

							<p>Lastly, we also embed information security and COOP requirements into the architecture from the start – a well-architected system, using the approach we describe, will lead to a more secure and reliable solution. Finally, we maximize cost efficiencies and mission effectiveness through integrated systems that use common and core services. Our EI Methodology is based on 3 core tenets:</p>

							<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9 global">

							<p class="highlight"><span>MISSION-DRIVEN.</span> Because missions cross organizations, it is critical to provide full traceability and visibility of systems, activities, and requirements to mission needs. This is the foundation for optimizing capabilities and mission readiness. In addition, changes must be quantifiable via clear mission impact.</p>

							<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9 global">
							<p class="highlight"><span>ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE.</span> Leaders need to understand capability/system gaps and redundancies across organizational boundaries, so they can make more informed decisions on intelligent technology injection and/or convergence, and deliver integrated SoS that meets mission needs. From the enterprise perspective, the government should take an ABCD approach when it comes to technology: Adopt first, Buy second, Create third, and Decommission fourth.</p>

							<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-3col-lg-3"><img src="images/ei-4.png" class="img-responsive" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
							<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9 global">
							<p class="highlight"><span>OPEN, MODULAR ARCHITECTURE.</span> The government needs to own the architecture, the system, and the data, thus reducing vendor lock-in and helping eliminate inefficiencies. In addition, the government needs to create modular architecture with open, interoperable, and well-defined interfaces to plug in new technologies when they become available, fostering innovation and reuse across the enterprise. </p>
						</div>
						</div>

						

						<p>The EI methodology to helped multiple clients transform their enterprise in an iterative, incremental fashion, allowing them to increase mission capabilities and reduce sustainment costs, but also have the coherence and specificity to accommodate incremental changes along the way. Our EI methodology is based on four phases - Assess, Architect, Assemble and Advance - that use visually rich artifacts to deliver integrated views of missions, stakeholders, processes, systems, and technologies that deliver enhanced solutions.</p>

												<p>The primary goal of the Assess phase is to analyze operational requirements and derive technical requirements in order to provide enterprise awareness and define service delivery recommendations based on the most efficient alignment to mission and technology priorities. Our mission driven approach provides full traceability and visibility of systems, activities, and capabilities to mission needs. This traceability enables transparency and integration throughout the Enterprise and helps inform decision-making efforts. The results from this analysis provide better understanding of the as-is architecture model, which would lead to an informed recommendation for to-be model. Often EI uses metrics and a scoring algorithm to assess the value of applications, sets of applications, and the health of the IT infrastructure as a whole. By gathering metrics such as an application’s age, how often it’s used, cost to maintain, performance, and relationships with other applications, a manager is well prepared to decide if particular application should be maintained, retired, enhanced, or consolidated. </p>

												<p>Once this assessment is complete, we begin to define the to-be architecture in the Architect phase. This phase employs in-depth technical considerations to define open architectures and supporting artifacts required to meet mission needs and accounting for information security requirements, while empowering the organization to make informed acquisition decisions and increase accountability of individual modernization efforts.</p> 
												<p>The goal is to design a cost-effective, interoperable enterprise architecture that promotes re-use, flexibility and decreased time-to-market. Support analysis, studies, and pilot efforts are also used to inform a prioritized service portfolio and delivery roadmap. Our core architect tenet is to apply an open architecture design approach. By defining modular components (micro services) we simplify development cycle, deployment cycle, maintenance cycle and future migration cycles. This will eliminate complexity (be removing redundant technologies and cross-cutting concerns) which results into increased productivity and reduced time-to-market. 
												</p>
												<p>It moves organizations towards automated service migration to a hybrid cloud environment for re-use across the Intelligence Community. The ‘Build-once, Use-Many times’ approach to these micro services addresses cross-cutting areas are advantages in many aspects; one is that the organization only invests once in understanding this problem area and develops a focused solution which is pluggable in other areas within the agency. This enables flexibility to leverage tailored industry specifications in order to promote shared standards and common infrastructures. These client-owned systems, combined with a specification-based approach, ease integration, improve interoperability, and increase speed of delivery. As new technologies are inserted, they are evaluated against the existing portfolio to ensure we create cost efficiencies where applicable and no new gaps or overlaps are introduced.</p>

Our approach embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven development, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. These tenets of Agile have proven to result in more valuable products at a faster pace, lower cost, higher quality, and with greater levels of customer satisfaction. To manage risk along the way, we create an incremental IT Roadmap that takes a phased approach to transition, identifying specific goals for each phase and ensuring minimal downtime or impact to IT operations. A delivery roadmap is created for each new technology or service to identify timeline, integration points, critical milestones as well as metrics to identify success along the way. We equip the enterprise with right tools to perform independent verification and validation testing to ensure the components meets the mission’s requirements and technical specifications.</p>

												<p>After successful migration and as part of the Advance Phase, we incorporate the changes into the architecture by adjusting the as-is baseline and set up advanced analytics to monitor the system and collect metrics in order to gain knowledge for future optimizations, identifying areas for re-use, consolidation, implementation of new technologies, and retirement of legacy technology and processes. In this phase we also emphasize performance-based evaluation, repeatability, and desirable service-level metrics to sustain a portfolio of applications while gaining efficiencies, reducing costs, and ensuring a quality program from initiation to execution and sustainment. Rather than simply maintain and enhance applications in a minimal “keep the lights on” mode, our approach enables continuous and measurable cost savings, while driving sustainable performance and improvement. </p>
												<p>Large-scale organizations are often reliant upon complex systems engineering to ensure mission success and meet business objectives. Many of these organizations grew organically over time, often in response to immediate and substantial challenges, thus short-cutting a comprehensive enterprise perspective. Our Enterprise Integration approach delivers the building blocks for today’s enterprises to develop and deploy modern architectures based on leading edge technologies. These modular components provide the control, flexibility, and coherence needed to simplify complex challenges and deliver a stable and Agile enterprise.</p>

						<h3>2.2 </br>ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION (EI) AND IT SERVICE MANAGEMENT (ITSM)</h3>
						<div class="lead">EI provides an enterprise blueprint for addressing cross-organizational mission needs through a portfolio of applications designed to meet common standards and built using open architecture.</div>

						<p>By incorporating a standard approach for requirements management/analysis and establishing a consistent methodology for assessing applications, EI structures the management of mission requirements decomposition and portfolio architecture so that Service Providers may execute application design and development according to IC ITE goals.</p>

						<p>The industry recognized IT Service Management (ITSM) framework is an integrated construct for guiding achievement of portfolio and platform goals through effective governance and management of IT services. It is grounded in organizational policies and structured in processes and procedures that are performed by the IC to plan, design, deliver, operate and control IT services to customers. It is concerned with the implementation of IT services that meet customers' needs, and it is performed by the IT service provider through an appropriate mix of people, process and information technology.</p>

						<p>EI is closely tied to ITSM which embodies ITIL-based methods to apply effective organizational structure, principles, policies, processes, and lessons learned. EI improves upon traditional ITSM models by integrating enterprise governance, program management, and ITSM to achieve critical program and portfolio objectives.</p>
