							<h2>The New IT Paradigm</h2>
							<div class="lead">The pace of change for disruptive digital technology is faster now than at any time in its short history.</div>
							<p>This constant technology evolution is forcing organizations to continuously upgrade in order to remain relevant, which introduces new challenges with bi-modal IT environments. These challenges range from legacy systems in the traditional environments, to the open and agile stage which enables massive re-use of services and portability of cloud resources to allow fast deployment of solutions. Furthermore, organizations are riding a continuous technology wave driven by a desire to improve user experiences and bear more functionality and intelligence as more operations move to the cloud.</p>

							<p>Leveraging new digital capabilities and with the continual evolution of newer digital ecosystems, there is an opportunity to “modernize” IT infrastructures to promote information sharing and set the stage for the adoption of new cost effective technologies that increase capabilities through faster delivery of intuitive IT systems, enhance data mining &amp; analytics, increase enterprise mobility, and ensure improved defense against cyber threats and vulnerabilities.</p>

							<p>To accomplish this, a network-centric approach must be adopted where digital capabilities are provided from fewer locations with centralized expertise within a center of excellence – allowing organizations to keep abreast of innovations, adopt new trends, and promote re-use across the enterprise in a constantly evolving technology ecosystem. This approach should become an organization’s best practice to reduce IT sustainment costs, increase IT infrastructure capacity, and enable more options to develop new capabilities, deploy software, and host applications.</p>

							<p>As an organization begins to shift from true traditional platform to common architectures, some of the challenges of having a closed architecture will start to evolve into semi-open where the architecture will become open so that solutions become more interoperable across systems, but the software is still closed/proprietary. Under this shift, improvements are also made in providing additional value to customers by employing some of the agile processes but time-to-market is not yet at its peak.</p>

										<p>“My primary responsibility is to provide a secure reliable network that supports our warfighter” – “ that means getting the data that they need on time, as well as getting access to data and applications that they need…” “…I am looking to make sure I have optimized our IT infrastructure to the maximum extent possible… where we need to optimize, where we need to modernize our infrastructure – moving into a hybrid architecture as we transition into IC ITE” </p>
										<footer>- Janice Glover-Jones, <cite title="Source Title">DIA CIO</cite></footer>
									</blockquote>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>As the transition matures and evolves to the stage of migration, the organization begins to have a more open source philosophical approach to development. This leads to architectural components being looked at as assets that can be shared and used across the enterprise. This will promote the culture of “write-once” and “re-use” multiple times which brings to bear speed in delivery and faster deployment of software. However, the aspect of software delivery is still being done in a manual fashion.</p>

							<p>For example, code might be automatically compiled in a heterogeneous development teams, but the packaging and deployment of software still relies on antiquated documents and manual process. These practices yield rapid but unreliable deployment. Not to mention many times, the systems have to be “offline/turned-off”, in order to ensure no data-loss.</p>

							</div>

							<p>At final phase of transition to the open, agile stage, an organization can claim the instantiation of an open architecture which reaps the benefits of standardization, interoperability, efficiency, and reuse. This results in an organization which mandates re-use of its resources and develops solutions with intention of making them open-source to other government agencies.</p>

							<p>Creating open-source solutions not only eases the burden on other organizations in usage of the software, but also it enables them to become future contributors to the solution and expanding its capabilities to larger user community. Finally, DevOps practices will become to pay dividends to rapid, reliable and fully automated software development and deployment. During this phase, organizations can deploy code with high degree of confidence since their deployment steps are now delivered “as-a-code” instead of documentation which relies on human’s attention to document and follow steps.</p>

							<p>The transition from traditional IT to next generation, cloud-based architectures is complex and requires careful analysis, planning, and execution in order to maximize the value proposition offered through digital modernization. The advent of cloud computing has added a new dimension and dynamic to the classic decision process and the factors that managers should consider when making long-term, short-term, contingency, and continuity plans for a critical business situation or response to a national emergency.</p>

							<p>Understanding the new dimensions and dynamics engendered by cloud computing and determining how best to apply and leverage them can improve mission performance, control information technology (IT) costs, reduce risk, accelerate capability and capacity development, and drive innovation. The main challenge of transitioning to a new IT enterprise is one of integration by developing an ecosystem that will serve as the fabric to sustain a single, standards based, interoperable enterprise architecture to accomplish mission objectives and drive efficiencies. </p>

							<p>The key to this approach is through strategic planning and use of a maturity model which provides structured ways to assess progress of the shared services implementation and address common standards to foster innovation within the enterprise. The most successful implementations balance standards and rigor with openness and flexibility to accommodate innovations at scale and continuous evolution of user requirements. The following subchapters outline best practices, roadmaps, approaches, and techniques that may be applied as digital enablers to help guide critical decisions during the IC’s digital transformation process.</p>

						<h3>4.1 </br>CLOUD COMPUTING VISIONING AND ROADMAPPING</h3>
						<div class="lead">Migrating an organization to leverage cloud services is a complex undertaking filled with technical, organizational, and financial risks. As such, its important to assess key cloud factors and recommend solutions that help key stakeholders and senior IT leaders develop strategic and tactical plans for their offices.</div>

						<p>Booz Allen has developed the cloud computing QLA to rapidly measure an organization’s readiness and suitability for cloud computing. The cloud computing QLA assesses eight Cloud Computing Factors (CCF) that represent key focus areas that are used to determine whether an organization is ready for cloud-based services from a holistic perspective.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="list-wrap">
								<ul class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
									<li>Mission &amp; Architecture</li>
									<li>Technology</li>
									<li>Economics</li>
									<li>Security</li>
								</ul>

								<ul class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
									<li>Policy</li>
									<li>IT Integration</li>
									<li>Organization</li>
									<li>Governance &amp; Change Management</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Booz Allen’s assessment of each cloud computing factor is presented through individual scorecards that offer an overall rating based on findings in the areas of people, process, and technology. QLA uses this analysis to create a tactical roadmap with key action steps to facilitate the organization’s adoption of cloud-based services. QLA also identifies and analyzes a set of “cloud candidates” across each of the CCFs. These cloud candidates include existing or planned applications/services, data stores, and/or infrastructure pools.</p>

						<p>Based on the analysis, QLA provides considerations for the future IT landscape. QLA consists of four phases, detailed below, that are used to capture, analyze, communicate, and report on the organization’s application portfolio; determine the readiness of the organization to use cloud based services; provide considerations for the future IT landscape; provide a transition strategy for the applications assessed; make tactical recommendations regarding people, process, and technology to improve readiness across each of the cloud computing factors; and provide both a high level and tactical roadmap for migration to the cloud.</p>

						<h3>4.2 </br>USE OF CLOUD REFERENCE ARCHITECTURES</h3>
						<div class="lead">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments allow open data and development so that organizations can publish and host integrated datasets and data-driven applications enabled through linkages of internal and external clouds.</div>

						<p>As such, cloud computing environments can be implemented in many fashions with either a single software package or with multiple software packages. Since the market is saturated with cloud technologies, selection of the right components is a complex undertaking. By using reference architectures in addition to unique business requirements, the IC can ensure that all components and functions that make up a cloud environment are accounted for and the software package(s) are selected to address each of them—with no missing pieces.</p>


						<p>To help clients navigate the crowded, fragmented, and continually evolving vendor landscape, the IC’s first step toward evolving its cloud architecture begins with using our Cloud Reference Architecture (CRA) to lay the foundation for the cloud environment implementation and ensure no pieces are missing.</p>

						<p>Booz Allen’s cloud infrastructure framework provides the foundation for any cloud implementation and a holistic approach to people, process and technology in three tightly integrated layers setting the stage for any cloud implementation—public, private or hybrid. For public cloud adoption, the orchestration and resource layer is typically the responsibility of the service provider. For private cloud adoption, the components implemented will depend on the services desired and respective requirements.</p>

						<p>Hybrid adoption will naturally be a balance of both. Furthermore, our framework offers enterprise scalability and a fully automated solution, which provides value including datacenter consolidation, elasticity, process improvement and efficiencies to lower total cost of ownership. Using a framework not only allows a greater range of choices in selecting resources and building services, it also allows for a faster, more streamlined, more secure, and lower risk deployment. This reference architecture has been used to support multiple cloud engagements and is critical for success. Our CRA provides the following benefits:</p>

Uncertainty regarding the implications of choices in this area and lack of understanding contribute to slow adoption. However, the cloud also provides new opportunities to improve security. Security in legacy environments can be difficult to apply and manage for several reasons including disparate systems, asset accountability, lack of unified management and policy enforcement, improper security design, and control implementation. Migrating to a cloud model can potent improve each of these areas and also offers the opportunity to build automated security controls into the infrastructure -increasing security posture and visibility into the environment.</p>

						<h3>4.3 </br>LEVERAGING CLOUD ANALYTICS / DATA SCIENCE</h3>
						<div class="lead">The ability to compete and win in the information economy will come from powerful analytics that draw insights and value from data, and from high fidelity visualizations that present those insights in impactful, intuitive ways.</div>

						<p>Though the implementation of cloud service models, the IC is looking to cloud analytics to create new opportunities and solve their most complex intelligence gathering problems – hoping to tap into the many rich new sources ofshared information. Despite this new capability, the size and diversity of big data make it difficult the use it in a meaningful way and explore all of the information at once to track overall trends and find patterns that can lead to valuable knowledge and insight.</p>


						<p>Datasets and analytics are highly structured, and must be torn down and rebuilt with each new line of inquiry. Information that does not neatly fit into such rigid structures often cannot be used. While organizations are collecting moreinformation than ever, the data tends to reside in silos that are difficult to integrate. Despite its benefits, cloud storage has not eliminated the data silos but has simply made them fatter.</p>


						<p>To leverage the transformative power of cloud analytics, organizations should leverage unique approaches that combine cloud and other technologies with superior analytic tradecraft to create breakthroughs in how organizations capture, store, correlate, pre-compute, and extract value from large sets of data. To understand the power of cloud analytics, it helps to see the progression from basic data analytics performed in most organizations today. An infrastructure is built out along the continuum to cloud analytics, the size and scale of data it can process increases along with the ability to drive performance and improve decision making. Basic data analysis usually happens in core business functions with smaller datasets. Reports are usually created on a ‘one-off” basis, limited to distribution within a specific department to support routine decision making.</p><br>

						</div>

						<p>Analysis using standard cloud computing solutions extends basic analytic techniques to large or very large datasets. This is a logical entry point for cloud solutions because cloud technology is the most efficient, cost-effective way to run analytics on large amounts of data. Advanced analytics is where predictive capabilities are brought into the mix. It’s generally used to evaluate the future impact of strategic decisions. Cloud Analytics transcends the limits of the other forms of analysis and delivers insights to answer previously unanswered questions in real-time.</p>

						<p>Organizations will vary in their level of data maturity and requirements in extracting business value from cloud analytics. Whether the objective is to simply gain IT efficiencies, modernize to handle advance analytics, or gain significant improvements in business performance, leveraging a scalable Cloud Analytics Reference Architecture will help to determine the entry point for data transformation to the digital enterprise. Our Cloud Analytics Reference Architecture provides a holistic approach to people, processes, and technology in four tightly coupled layers comprising the technical infrastructure, management of data, analytics tools, and visualizations for the end user.</p>

						<p>It is a layered framework which helps to leverage the assets owned and take logical steps to add what’s required in order to build a structure to instrument data to maximize breakthrough analytics. It incorporates a wide range of capabilities to move from chaotic infrastructure with distributed data to large scale data processing and analytics characterized by speed, precision, security, scalability, and cost efficiency.</p>

						<h3>4.4 </br>EXPLOITING THE BENEFITS OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE</h3>
						<div class="lead">As defined by the Department of Defense, “Open Source Software (OSS) is software for which the human-readable source code is available for use, study, reuse, modification, enhancement, and redistribution by the users of that software.</div>

						<p>In other words, OSS is software for which the source code is ‘open.’ Open source facilitates the adoption of technologies that increase capabilities through open architectures to promote interoperability, open source components to maximize reusability, open standards to foster cohesive development, open communities to share our innovation, and open data to make information freely available to everyone to use without restriction.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="list-wrap">
								<ul class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
									<li class="highlight"><span>OPEN ARCHITECTURES</span> - vanquishes inflexible enterprises and permits interoperability; Open architectures allow systems to easily connect to other devices, apps, and systems.</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>OPEN SOURCE</span> - allows the industry to learn through the reuse of the best open source code</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>OPEN STANDARDS</span> - provides the foundation that enable communities to raise up great ideas together</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>OPEN COMMUNITIES</span> - extend the freedom to explore, examine, and scout new ideas from a global ecosystem</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>OPEN DATA</span> - allows technologists to freely access, explore, and reconfigure their datasets</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>


						<p>The most common philosophical position open source developers and advocates take is that Open Source empowers innovation. This view believes in the innovative power of people, especially in large numbers; it also assumes that what will benefit one group will likely benefit other groups.</p>

						<p>Open Source as a philosophy provides a sound economic development environment by creating communities of interest and empowering them to grow that community. A natural outgrowth of the Open Source philosophy is the spontaneous development of widely varied communities of interest that collectively make up the Open Source Community. Many consider this grassroots growth of Open Source communities a social movement. Although the “social movement” classification may be an overstatement, the fact that there is an active community of Open Source developers in undeniable.</p>

						<p>Furthermore, the use of open source is a practical solution to common IT problems. Redundant problems should never be met with redundant problem solving. Open Source provides a practical solution to common problems that recur throughout the IC. Once a problem is identified and a software solution has been created under an Open Source license, the solution can be shared and re-implemented rather than having to be re-invented.</p>

						<p class="highlight"><span>BENEFITS OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE:</span> Open source software (OSS) is crowd-sourced. As a result it has benefits—cost, flexibility, freedom, security, and accountability—that are unsurpassed by propriety software solutions. Moreover, OSS has long-term viability and is always on the cutting-edge of technology. Unlike closed proprietary software, OSS can be altered and extended by any developer familiar with the source code. This grants organizations freedom from “vendor lock-in” and assures long-term viability. The Open Source model harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency to create high-quality, secure and easily integrated software at an accelerated pace.</p>

						<p>It is created and supported by a worldwide community of organizations and individual developers, many of whom also live by open source values like collaboration and volunteerism. A widely adopted OSS project is often supported by hundreds of capable development shops that can always be called upon long into the future. These same development shops are constantly reviewing the OSS code they support, as are thousands of independent developers working on the project worldwide. The result is a vast peer review process that ensures security and accountability. They believe in working together to build free, high quality products that are accessible to for-profit and non-profit organizations alike</p>

						<p>Primary benefits of open source software are as follows:</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="list-wrap">
								<ul class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
									<li class="highlight"><span>Prevent Vendor Lock-in:</span> By its very nature, the source code of open source software is available to all, meaning that no one company owns the software. Any company can build upon open source software. It may be operated and maintained by multiple vendors, reducing both barriers to entry and exit. A customer can easily choose another vendor because they are not locked in to one vendor’s offering.</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>Reliability:</span> Open source is peer reviewed software, which breeds higher degrees of reliability. The infrastructure of the Internet is largely composed of open-source programs such as DNS, sendmail, Apache and languages such as HTML and Perl. They have proven to be both reliable and robust under the most strenuous conditions, mainly due to the fast growth of the Internet. In addition, Open source enables anyone to examine software for security flaws. The continuous and broad peer-review enabled by publicly available source code improves security through the identification and elimination of defects that might otherwise be missed. The availability of source code also facilitates in-depth security reviews and audits.</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>Reduced Cost:</span> Open source software is often developed through community forums and collaborative. Developers volunteer their time and expertise, and are coordinated by fewer paid programmers. The lower overhead costs translate into substantial savings, as does the fact that open source software typically does not have a per-seat licensing cost. The cost benefit alone makes open source highly appealing since the vast majority of the code is freely distributed. Open source services such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and CodePlan are commonly used to host open source software projects and provide features such as distributed version control, source code management, and collaboration features which fosters peer review and further promotes innovation.</li>
									<li class="highlight"><span>Faster prototyping and adoption:</span> With open source software consumers no longerhave to wait years to deploy a solution. Open source software can be “test driven” prior to procurement, and is particularly suitable for inter-agency collaboration, rapid prototyping and experimentation.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The U.S. Government is increasing its commitment to improving the way Federal agencies buy, build, and deliver IT and software solutions to better support cost efficiency, mission effectiveness, and the consumer experience with Government programs. When Federal agencies are unable to identify an existing Federal or commercial software solution that satisfies their specific needs, they may choose to develop a custom software solution on their own or pay for its development. However, when agencies procure custom-developed source code, they do not necessarily make their new code broadly available for Government-wide reuse. Additionally, when agencies are in a position to share their source code, it isn’t made available to other agencies in a consistent manner. In some cases, agencies may even have difficulty establishing that the software was produced in the performance of a Federal Government contract. These challenges may result in duplicative acquisitions for similar code and an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. </p>
								<p>The government’s new Federal Source Code Policy seeks to address these challenges by ensuring that new custom-developed Federal source code be made broadly available for reuse across the Federal Government. This evolving memorandum enables Federal employees to work together— both within and across agencies—to reduce costs, streamline development, apply uniform standards, and leverage reuse of custom-developed code to decrease duplicative costs and vendor lock-in.

						<h3>4.5 </br>ENTERPRISE DEVOPS</h3>
						<div class="lead">Today, the IC continues its transition into an open, agile, enterprise stage to extract the benefits of shared information, standardization, interoperability, and reuse.</div>

						<p>With every IC element that adopts the cloud computing shared services model, it can exploit the benefits of on-demand hosting capabilities (IaaS) and the use of agile tools for rapid development and deployment of software (PaaS). Together, these models allow IC elements to leverage agile software development practices to deliver capabilities at a rapid pace to end users.</p>

						<p>However, implementing agile development in larger organizations can be a very complex and challenging endeavor. Agile practices that can scale and address the needs of enterprise endeavors, including mission-critical systems, involves a lot more than just a stand-up meeting each morning and fixed time box sprints. Successful organizations want to see each and every project that employs agile processes enjoy the same level of success in terms of productivity and quality.</p>

						<p>Agile is a development methodology based on principles that embrace collaboration and constant feedback as the pillars of its iterative process, allowing features to be developed faster and in alignment with what businesses and users need. However, operations today are generally moving at a pace that’s still geared toward sequential waterfall processes. As Agile SD took off, new pressures and challenges began building to address delivering new code into test, quality assurance, and production environments as quickly as possible without losing visibility and quality. We define DevOps simply as the culture, principles, and processes that automate and streamline the end-to-end flow from code development to delivering the features/changes to users in production.</p>

						<p>Without DevOps, Agile SD is a powerful tool but with a prominent limitation—it fails to address software delivery. As with other software development processes, Agile stops when production deployment begins, opening a wide gap between users, developers, and the operations team because the features developed for a time boxed sprint won’t be deployed to production until the scheduled release goes out, often times many months later. DevOps enhances Agile SD by filling this critical gap, bridging operations and development as a unified team and process.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="container">
					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 intro" id="article-wrap" style="top:0;">

						<p>Agile SD is based in part on short sprints—perhaps a week in duration— during which a section of an application or a program feature is developed. Questions arise: “How do you deliver each new version of this software quickly, reliably, securely, and seamlessly to your entire user base? How do you meet the operational requirements to iterate frequent software development and upgrades without constant disruption and overhead? How do you ensure that continuous improvement in software development translates into continuous improvement throughout the organization? How do you ensure that there is continuous delivery of programs during a sprint as they are developed?”</p>

						<p>It is from such questions that DevOps has emerged—a natural evolution of the Agile mindset applied to the needs of operations. The goals of a DevOps implementation are to fully realize the benefits that Agile SD aims to provide in reducing risk, increasing velocity, and improving quality.</p>

						<p>By integrating software developers, quality control, security engineers, and IT operations, DevOps provides a platform for new software or for fixes to be deployed into production as quickly as it is coded and tested. That’s the idea, anyway—but it is a lot easier said than done. Although DevOps addresses a fundamental need, it is not a simple solution to master. To excel at DevOps, enterprises must do the following:</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="list-wrap">
								<ul class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
									<li>Transform their cultures</li>
									<li>Change the way software is designed and built following a highly modular mindset</li>
									<li>Automate legacy processes</li>
									<li>Design contracts to enable the integration of operations and development </li>
								</ul>

								<ul class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
									<li>Collaborate, and then collaborate more</li>
									<li>Honestly assess performance</li>
									<li>Continually reinvent software delivery strategies based on lessons learned and project requirements.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>To achieve the type of change described is a daunting task, especially with large enterprises that have processes and legacy technologies that are ingrained as part of their business. There are numerous patterns, techniques, and strategies for DevOps offered by well-known technology companies. However, these approaches tend to be too general and insufficient by themselves to address the many issues that arise in each DevOps implementation, which vary depending on the organization’s size, user base, resources, priorities, technology capabilities, development goals, and so on.</p>

						<p>Given these shortcomings, evident to us from our extended experience with DevOps implementations, Booz Allen has devised an approach for adopting DevOps that is comprehensive yet flexible. Think of this DevOps playbook as your user guide for implementing a practical style of DevOps that stresses teamwork and mission focus to achieve a single unyielding goal: deliver new value to users continually by delivering software into production rapidly and efficiently on an ongoing basis. It serves as a guide for implementing DevOps in your organization—a practical roadmap that you can use to define your starting point, the steps, and the plan required to meet your DevOps goals.</p>
